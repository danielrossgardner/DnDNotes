      <div class="abstract">The western edge of Veythar is a place of endurance and silence, where people live beneath
      the shadow of the Great
      Vulture, and the sea whispers softly against the desert’s edge.</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overview:</strong> The western edge of Veythar is a land of contrasts — sparse coasts, lonely ridges,
          and wide deserts. Few settlements endure here, but those who do live by hardy farming, herding, and a deep
          reverence for the spirits of survival.</li>

        <li><strong>Caprine Coast:</strong> The coastline here is gentler than the storm-tossed east. Long sandy beaches and
          sheltered coves make fishing possible, and a few small villages hug the shore, living from the sea’s quiet bounty.
          Scattered springs inland support pockets of hardy farmers who cultivate olives, barley, and drought-resistant
          herbs. South of the hills, scrubland sustains small herds of goats, while life moves at the pace of the rains —
          rare but transformative, turning the land green in sudden bursts.</li>

        <li><strong>Empty Ridges:</strong> Beyond the coast rise bleak, stony hills at the tail of the Veythar Spine. Few
          settlements thrive here, and those that do are small and self-sufficient. Trade is rare, and travelers are met
          with caution but often given shelter, for hospitality is survival in such a sparse land. The ridges feel abandoned
          and windswept, with only scattered shepherds, hermits, or mystics wandering among the rocks. The higher ridges
          fold into the Spine’s peaks, marking the transition into harsher terrain.</li>

        <li><strong>Northern Desert:</strong> Rolling dunes sweep across the northwest, following the transition from stony
          flats to barren sands. Few plants grow here beyond thornbrush and sparse grass, though hardy nomads sometimes pass
          through in small caravans.</li>

        <li><strong>Southern Desert:</strong> South of the Empty Ridges lies the arid heartland, where dwarves build
          Petra-like stone cities into canyon walls. From here, spice caravans depart toward the west and north, connecting
          scattered villages along the margins of the desert.</li>

        <li><strong>Spiritual Reverence:</strong> The people of the western lands honor the <em>Great Vulture</em>, a vast
          spirit said to circle above the dunes and ridges. Sightings of its shadow are seen as omens of endurance, for the
          vulture thrives where little else survives. Offerings of bone, salt, or dried meat are left on ridge-top cairns to
          call for its protection.</li>
