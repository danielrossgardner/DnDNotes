          “From rot we rise, in soil we sleep,

        <strong>Summary:</strong> North of Willowford, beyond the Silverstream Mines and into the ravines and hills, lie a
        cluster of ancient caves — once sanctuaries of a forgotten human sect known as the <em>Order of the Pale Garden</em>.
        The order revered decay as divine transformation, teaching that all rot was but the earth’s slow breath, turning
        death into new life.
      </div>

        <p>
          The Pale Gardeners taught that <em>the garden of life is fed by the pale harvest of death</em>. Every living thing,
          they claimed, blooms twice: once in sunlight, and once in shadow. To them, the fungus was the holiest of forms —
          neither plant nor beast, thriving in the quiet dark and turning death into nourishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their hymns spoke of “<em>the Deep Bloom</em>,” a sacred cycle embodied by a spirit said to dwell beneath the
          earth — a being of pale filaments and gentle light that consumed corruption and returned balance. Though many
          dismissed these tales as symbolic, some whispered that the Deep Bloom was a true spirit of rot and rebirth, and
          that the Pale Gardeners tended to its caverns.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Primary Symbol:</strong> A mushroom-like vine coiled into a circle, its stem looping to meet its own root —
            representing the eternal cycle of decay and renewal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simplified Mark:</strong> A ring marked with five dots of varying sizes, symbolizing spores spreading
            through unseen soil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Imagery:</strong> Murals and carvings often depicted gardens blooming from grave soil, human figures
            merging with fungi, and luminous spirits guiding decay toward rebirth.

        <p>
          During the wars of the Silverstream Warchiefs, the Order refused to swear allegiance to the conquering banners.
          Their caves became sanctuaries for the wounded and the weary — a quiet resistance rooted in compassion and humble
          defiance.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the warlord’s forces came, the Pale Gardeners were massacred, their sanctuaries sealed, their relics scattered.
          Local folklore claims that the earth itself “swallowed their songs,” leaving only the soft hum of mushrooms in the
          dark.

        <h2 id="ritual-tools"><strong>Ritual Tools &amp; Relics</strong></h2>
        <p>
          The Pale Gardeners crafted sacred implements that blended ritual purpose with lingering spiritual power. A few of
          these tools still hold faint magic:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Trowel of Quiet Bloom</strong><br>
            <em>Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or cleric)</em><br>
            A small bronze trowel etched with curling spores. When used to plant or bury organic matter, it accelerates decay
            and renewal.<br>
            • Once per long rest, you can cast <em>Plant Growth</em> or <em>Gentle Repose</em> (your choice).<br>
            • You have advantage on checks to identify or cultivate fungi and other decomposers.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Sporeveil Censer</strong><br>
            <em>Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>
            A clay censer shaped like a mushroom cap, carved with spiraling vents. When lit, it releases silvery spores that
            shimmer faintly.<br>
            • As an action, you can activate it to cast <em>Protection from Poison</em> (self only).<br>
            • Once per day, you can release a cloud that grants you and up to three creatures within 10 ft
            resistance to necrotic damage for 10 minutes.<br>
            • In dim light, faint motes of light drift around you while it’s active, like glowing spores.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Though forgotten by the people of Willowford, faint carvings and relics remain in the caves above the mines. The
          corrupted mushroom spirit festering below may once have been the <em>Deep Bloom</em> the order revered — its sacred
          cycle now broken and twisted into ruin.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="panel">
        <h2 id="lore-legends"><strong>Local Lore &amp; Surviving Knowledge</strong></h2>
        <p>
          In Willowford and nearby hamlets, the <em>Order of the Pale Garden</em> lingers only as a whisper in old miner tales.
          The caves north of the mines are called the <strong>“Pale Hollows”</strong> — said to be haunted by “white gardeners”
          who tend unseen roots beneath the earth. Children leave wilted flowers at cave mouths to “feed the soil spirits,” a
          custom with forgotten origins.
        </p>
        <p>
          A modern scholar or cleric researching animist sects of the region might find scattered references to an order that
          “worshiped the stillness between death and growth.” Fragmented prayers recovered from old manuscripts mention
          <em>“the Deep Bloom beneath all things”</em> and <em>“the circle that eats itself to be whole.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          A few scholars speculate the Pale Gardeners were an early syncretic movement — blending rural animism with pre-druidic
          rites. Most dismiss them as a minor cult extinguished during the Silverstream wars, though some suspect their beliefs
          seeded later traditions of burial gardens and composting rituals still practiced in the northern valleys.
