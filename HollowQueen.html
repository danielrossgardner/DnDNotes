    <div class="panel">

      <h3><strong>The Queen Beneath</strong></h3>
      <p>Long before the Age of Echoes, there was a mortal queen — <strong>Nerathis of the Hollow Crown</strong> — whose
        hunger for dominion eclipsed all mercy. Legends say she ruled from the mountain fortress of <em>Vey Lethan</em>,
        where she sought to forge unity through fear. When her seers warned her that the spirits would never kneel, she
        ordered a massacre upon a mountain town that refused her tithe, slaughtering spirit-tenders, druids, and
        innocents alike.</p>
      <p>That act of cruelty scarred the land itself. The mountain screamed. A <strong>seed of corruption</strong> took
        root in the blood-soaked earth, binding her soul to it even as her body perished in the uprising that followed.
        Her spirit, denied peace, sank into the dark between worlds. There it fed upon pain, ambition, and the echoes of
        mortal prayer, until it became something <em>other</em>.</p>
      <p>Now, deep beneath Veythar, the <strong>Queen Beneath</strong> dreams and whispers — her will a bridge between
        this world and a reflection of it beyond, a chaotic realm twisting slowly into a <strong>cruel parody of
          creation</strong>.</p>

      <h3><strong>The Domain Beyond</strong></h3>
      <p>The realm linked to her essence was once a place of formless chaos — the source of corruption itself. Yet the
        Queen’s tether has shaped it over the ages, sculpting it into a dark mirror of Veythar’s landscapes: mountains
        of bone, seas of ink, and forests of whispering glass.</p>
      <p>This <strong>realm of chaos and corruption</strong>, often called <em>the domain beyond</em> or
        <em>Llygredd</em>, grows more defined each time corruption spills into the mortal realm. Where spirits exist in
        harmony here, their reflections there are <em>distorted parodies</em> of themselves — driven to devour rather
        than balance.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>The Queen’s Influence</strong></h3>
      <p>Though bound, the Queen’s will seeps through the cracks between worlds. She cannot manifest directly, but she
        <strong>inhabits mortal minds</strong> — artists, scholars, dreamers, and cultists — through dreams and
        inspiration. Those touched by her influence often become <strong>architects of ruin</strong>, driven to
        construct shrines, monuments, or geometric carvings that resonate with the corruption’s frequency.
      </p>
      <p>Each of these sites, when completed, acts as a <strong>key-stone</strong> in an invisible pattern across
        Veythar — a vast sigil that will, when complete, <strong>open the Growing Gate</strong>, merging both realms
        completely.</p>

      <h3><strong>Symbols and Signs</strong></h3>
      <p>Everywhere her touch lingers, one symbol returns again and again — its shape adapted but its pattern
        consistent:</p>
      <blockquote>A <strong>spiral descending into a hollow circle</strong>, encircled by seven lines that never meet.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Some carve it as a <em>spiral eye</em>, others as a <em>well</em>, or a <em>crown made of broken rings</em> —
        but always, it echoes descent, unity, and emptiness.</p>
      <p>Her followers whisper her names in secret — <em>The Hollow Crown, The Queen Beneath, The Silent Mother, The
          Voice Below</em>. Common phrases or passcodes might change between groups, but always revolve around the same
        idea:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“The crown turns inward.”</li>
        <li>“What is buried will reign.”</li>
        <li>“All echoes end in silence.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><strong>Ritual Sites and Structures</strong></h3>
      <p>Throughout Veythar, <strong>ritual sites</strong> are being built, repaired, or unearthed — each drawing from a
        distinct local culture yet sharing uncanny geometry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shrines with <strong>inverted altars</strong> or <strong>upside-down sigils</strong>.</li>
        <li>Caves where light never reaches the floor, always spiraling downward.</li>
        <li>Stone circles with seven broken pillars.</li>
        <li>Temples where water runs up walls instead of down.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Spirit-tenders call these places <em>the Hollow Marks</em> — points where the veil between worlds thins. Not
        all are complete, and not all are active… but each pulse makes the <strong>Queen’s Gate grow stronger</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Adventurer Clues</strong></h3>
      <p>Characters investigating corruption might notice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The same <strong>spiral symbol</strong> etched into unrelated ruins, charms, or cult markings.</li>
        <li>Recurrent dreams of <em>a woman’s voice</em> speaking from a pool of black ink; smooth except lips that
          protrude.</li>
        <li>Shrines whose offerings rot instantly — a sign that the Queen’s influence seeps through.</li>
        <li>Fractured cult doctrines that all end with the same whispered benediction:<br>
          <blockquote>“May her crown close around the world.”</blockquote>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Web of Echoes — Core Function</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Hollow Queen’s influence forms a continent-spanning sigil made up of all Hollow Marks (ritual sites),
          creating a metaphysical network called <strong>the Web of Echoes</strong>.</li>
        <li>Each Hollow Mark functions as a <strong>node</strong>.</li>
        <li>Corrupted spirit-energy forms <strong>ley-like Threads</strong> between nodes.</li>
        <li>Threads activate partially as each site becomes complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Full activation</strong> requires a ritual performed during the designated cosmic event,
          synchronizing all Threads in a single pulse.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Cosmic Event: The Shadowfall of the Umbral Wolf</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Constellation:</em> <strong>The Umbral Wolf</strong> — jagged stars depicting a great predator stalking
          the boundary between worlds.</li>
        <li><em>Event:</em> A <strong>triple eclipse</strong> (sun → moon → sun) caused by an invisible “dark mirror
          moon.” When it crosses before the Umbral Wolf, the Wolf’s shadow is cast across parts of Veythar.</li>
        <li><em>Season:</em> <strong>Autumn</strong>, when boundaries thin and twilight lingers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tracking the Cults</h2>
      <h3>A. Common Traces Found at Sites</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Whorls of <strong>chalky dust</strong> from Llygredd.</li>
        <li>Repeating <strong>spiral motifs</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold spots</strong> that chill the skin and evoke dread.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Fractured Cult Factions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each faction interprets the Queen’s fractured voice differently.</li>
        <li><strong>Signatures:</strong> Their own spiral symbol variant, unique passphrases, and preferred site types
          (caves, inverted shrines, stone circles, water-temples).</li>
        <li><strong>Adventurer Interference Includes:</strong> providing false intel, inciting faction conflicts,
          removing key members, or corrupting required ritual materials.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. NPC Dreamers & the Touched</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dream-marked mortals may speak prophecies in their sleep, unconsciously draw the sigil, or be drawn toward
          nearby sites.</li>
        <li>Some hear <strong>humming or whispers</strong> when near active Threads.</li>
        <li><strong>Questioning or protecting</strong> such individuals reveals site directions, active cult factions,
          and ritual timing.</li>
        <li>Some are cultists, some are innocents — all are useful clues.</li>
