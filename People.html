                            miners, and farmers. Many in Willowford admire her fairness, generosity, and ability to bring wealth to the community.
                            Children know her as the guildmistress who hands out sweets during festivals, while the council values her skill at
                            securing favorable trade contracts.</p>

                                Beneath her polished image, Selene orchestrates a discreet drug smuggling network. Using her control of silver
                                shipments, she conceals and exports powdered spores derived from corrupted fungi found in sealed caverns beneath the
                                Silverstream Hills. The substance, known as “<a href="Things.html#hollowdust">Hollowdust</a>” among its users, induces euphoria and heightened sensitivity
                                but is dangerously addictive, eroding body and mind over time.

                        <li><em>Profession:</em> Village scholar who studies the magical echoes of the Old Willow Tree and

                            <p class="text--smaller mt-none">The Old Willow Tree is not just a shrine — it’s a resting place for many lesser spirits, and over centuries, their
                            presence has left resonant imprints in the world. Toma believes these are what he calls “magical echoes.”</p>

                                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Spirit Residue:</em> When villagers pray, offer gifts, or celebrate at the tree, faint traces of spirit energy linger. These
                                impressions accumulate like layers of incense smoke over generations.</li>
                                
                                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Whispers of the Past:</em> On still nights, Toma claims to hear faint voices or feel visions of past festivals and offerings.
                                These aren’t ghosts, but “memories” left by the spirits.</li>
                                
                                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Spell Resonance:</em> Certain spells (divination, augury, commune) cast near the tree are unusually potent or produce unusual
                                side effects — glimpses of long-dead druids, voices of forgotten ancestors, flashes of natural cycles yet to come.</li>
                                
                                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Aura of Fertility:</em> The soil around the tree is unnaturally rich. Even plants near it grow strong, and small animals
                                frequently linger there, seemingly unafraid.</li>
                                
                                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Mystical Harmonics:</em> Toma describes the echoes as a “humming undercurrent,” like a string plucked but never fading. He
                                theorizes it may be the collective breath of countless spirits tied to Willowford’s land.</li>

                            <p class="text--smaller mb-none">For Toma, studying these echoes means learning how spirit energy persists and communicates with mortals. He hopes one
