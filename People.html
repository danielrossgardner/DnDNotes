              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Public Persona:</em>
              <p class="text--smaller ml-medium mt-none">Selene is renowned for her charm and wit. She is a deft
                negotiator, always able to smooth tensions between traders,
                miners, and farmers. Many in Willowford admire her fairness, generosity, and ability to bring wealth to
                the community.
                Children know her as the guildmistress who hands out sweets during festivals, while the council values
                her skill at
                securing favorable trade contracts.</p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Secret Life:</em>
              <p class="text--smaller ml-medium mt-none">
                Beneath her polished image, Selene orchestrates a discreet drug smuggling network. Using her control of
                silver
                shipments, she conceals and exports powdered spores derived from corrupted fungi found in sealed caverns
                beneath the
                Silverstream Hills. The substance, known as “<a href="Things.html#hollowdust">Hollowdust</a>” among its
                users, induces euphoria and heightened sensitivity
                but is dangerously addictive, eroding body and mind over time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><em>Operation: </em>
              <ul class="text--smaller">
                <li>The powder is pressed into false seams within silver ingots or hidden in grain sacks shipped
                  downriver.</li>
                <li>A small circle of trusted smugglers and ferrymen carry out the work, loyal to Selene either through
                  coin or fear of exposure.</li>
                <li>She maintains plausible deniability, ensuring she is never seen handling <a
                    href="Things.html#hollowdust">Hollowdust</a> directly.</li>
                <li>Selene Veyra’s smugglers secretly cultivate the fungi in a cavern away from the worst infestations.
                </li>
                <li>Harvesters wear damp cloth masks and protective charms against the spirit’s corruption.</li>
                <li>Even then, many of them bear fungal scars or chronic coughs.</li>
                <li>The Black Veil - smuggling ring
                  <p class="text--smaller"><strong>symbol:</strong> A set of three downward lines fanning like gills of
                    a mushroom. When drawn thickly in ink, it looks like draped cloth (a “veil”). Symbolizes secrecy and
                    shadow, but insiders see it as “the gills.”</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The Black Veil Shrines</strong>
                  <br />
                  At first glance, the shrines look like ordinary roadside cairns or waystones: stacked river-stones
                  with small carvings of trade runes or prayers to the Silverstream spirits. Travelers passing by would
                  see nothing unusual — they resemble the countless spirit-markers scattered throughout Veythar.
                  <br />
                  A thin strip of dark cloth (dyed black with mushroom ink) is tucked between two stones, fluttering
                  only in the right wind.
                  <br />
                  Beneath the stones is a silver sigil carved — resembling the downward gills of a mushroom — invisible
                  unless the cairn is dismantled.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Enchantment Source</strong> The silver sigil is blackened because it is fused with corrupted
                  spores and has a ring of arcane symbols around it.

          <ul>
            <li><em>Race/Class:</em> Human Wizard 6 (Divination, retired)</li> <a class="text--smaller"
              href="Hooks.html#toma-hook">forage in forest</a>
            <li><em>Profession:</em> Village scholar who studies the magical echoes of the Old Willow Tree and
              its spirits.</li>
            <li><em>Studies:</em>
              <p class="text--smaller mt-none">The Old Willow Tree is not just a shrine — it’s a resting place for many
                lesser spirits, and over centuries, their
                presence has left resonant imprints in the world. Toma believes these are what he calls “magical
                echoes.”</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Spirit Residue:</em> When villagers pray, offer gifts, or celebrate at the
                  tree, faint traces of spirit energy linger. These
                  impressions accumulate like layers of incense smoke over generations.</li>

                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Whispers of the Past:</em> On still nights, Toma claims to hear faint
                  voices or feel visions of past festivals and offerings.
                  These aren’t ghosts, but “memories” left by the spirits.</li>

                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Spell Resonance:</em> Certain spells (divination, augury, commune) cast
                  near the tree are unusually potent or produce unusual
                  side effects — glimpses of long-dead druids, voices of forgotten ancestors, flashes of natural cycles
                  yet to come.</li>

                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Aura of Fertility:</em> The soil around the tree is unnaturally rich. Even
                  plants near it grow strong, and small animals
                  frequently linger there, seemingly unafraid.</li>

                <li class="text--smaller"><em>Mystical Harmonics:</em> Toma describes the echoes as a “humming
                  undercurrent,” like a string plucked but never fading. He
                  theorizes it may be the collective breath of countless spirits tied to Willowford’s land.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text--smaller mb-none">For Toma, studying these echoes means learning how spirit energy persists
                and communicates with mortals. He hopes one
                day to distill that essence into protective wards or divination tools.</p>
