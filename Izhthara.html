    <h1 id="northwest-desert"><strong>Northwest Desert — Izh’thara (The Sun’s Mirage)</strong></h1>
    <div class="panel"> <strong>Also Known As:</strong> Sun’s Mirage (outsiders), <em>Izh’thara</em> — “Land of
      Windsong” (tabaxi name).<br> <strong>Tone:</strong> Harsh and poetic — a place of wind, storm, and careful
      ceremony where spirits shape every step of the nomads’ lives.<br> <strong>Principal Spirits:</strong> The Great
      Golden Eagle (Tempest) — <em>Kareshi</em>; The Great Vulture (Death) — <em>Zharu</em>. </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="geography"><strong>Geography</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Southern Rim — Vulture’s Reach:</strong> Rocky foothills where the desert meets the central mountains. Cairns of bone, feather, and salt stand as shrines to the Great Vulture Spirit (death, endurance). Pilgrimages here are grim affairs, meant to prepare the soul for hardship or loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Central Desert — Eagle’s Dominion:</strong> Windswept plateaus and shifting dunes. Tempests tear through, believed to be the wings of the Golden Eagle Spirit (tempest, sky). Here the nomads roam most freely, following herds and the stars.</li>
        <li><strong>Northern Wastes:</strong> Gravel plains and rare oases. Few venture here, but ruins of ancient shrines suggest past peoples once courted the desert spirits.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2 id="tabaxi-nomads"><strong>Tabaxi Nomads of Izh’thara</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>Movement:</strong> The tabaxi travel by season along ancestral <em>songlines</em> — long poetic routes
        that record water, hazards, and sacred places. Migration is as much cultural as practical: paths are sung and
        taught to each generation.</p>
      <p><strong>Mounts & Herds:</strong> They tend herds of <em>dune-camels</em> — two-humped, woolly beasts adapted to
        the sun and sand, used for milk, meat, transport, and companionship. Rarely, foals blessed by Kareshi show
        storm-markings (streaked fur, quick reflexes).</p>
      <p><strong>Social Structure:</strong> Matriarchal clans led by Elder-Mothers. Women carry social, spiritual, and
        legal authority; men frequently serve as poets, scouts, or storm-chanters (bards/clerics).</p>
      <p><strong>Poetic Formality:</strong> Conversation often opens with a formal greeting-poem. Improvised verse is
        prized as wit and respect. Shrines are decorated with wind-chimes that sing in the gales.</p>
      <p><strong>Gold Bracelets:</strong> Thin gold bracelets mark coming-of-age and are given as honors. Bracelets are
        never traded; gifting one is a profound expression of respect. Respected elders may wear many bracelets gathered
        over a lifetime.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="spirits"><strong>Spirits of the Desert</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kareshi — The Great Golden Eagle (Tempest):</strong> Bringer of storms, the tempests are said to be
          the beating of Kareshi’s wings. Honored for both their life-giving rains and destructive power.</li>
        <li><strong>Zharu — The Great Vulture (Death):</strong> Not malevolent but inevitable. Zharu’s domain is
          endurance, the proper disposal of the dead, and the balanced cycle of hunger and preservation.</li>
        <li><strong>Lesser Spirits:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sand-Mother:</strong> A shifting dune-spirit that shelters travelers from sudden storms.</li>
            <li><strong>Stone-Lion:</strong> A guardian spirit of courage roaming the northern wastes.</li>
            <li><strong>Whispering Well:</strong> The spirit of hidden water that tests favours with riddles and
              offerings.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="traditions-rituals"><strong>Traditions & Rituals</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shrines:</strong> Small stacked-stone pillars (cairns) topped with feathers, carved bone, and
          wind-chimes. Caravans add offerings: a carved verse, a strip of cloth, or a small token of a herd animal.</li>
        <li><strong>Coming-of-Age:</strong> Youth must recite the clan’s Journey-Poem at sunrise to receive their first
          gold bracelet. The recital must be near-flawless — mistakes are corrected publicly with gentle, ritualized
          teasing and retaught songs.</li>
        <li><strong>Funerary Rite:</strong> The dead are wrapped in white linen and placed on high cairns to be “given
          to Zharu’s wings.” Bones and personal tokens are left as thanks for the Vulture’s care.</li>
        <li><strong>Storm-Dances:</strong> Before migration a clan performs dances embodying bird and wind. Elders lead,
          youth mimic, and the rhythm fetches Kareshi’s favor for safe travel.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="interaction-with-outsiders"><strong>Contact with Outsiders</strong></h2>
      <p>Because of harsh conditions and tightly held songline knowledge, tabaxi rarely stay long in settled towns.
        Outsiders are judged by their humility and willingness to learn — and by their respect for bracelets and
        shrines. Trade is cautious and ritualized; gifts of cloth, salt, and simple tools are valued far more than coin.

      <h2 id="adventure-hooks"><strong>Adventure Hooks</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Silent Shrine:</strong> A central shrine to Kareshi has been defiled — its chimes stolen and the
          winds unnaturally calm. The nomads fear Kareshi’s displeasure. Investigation reveals a Burrowed Hand cell
          manipulating spirit-echoes nearby.</li>
        <li><strong>Bracelets of Betrayal:</strong> A caravan leader is murdered and her gold bracelets taken. The taboo
          of stolen honor risks clan feuds. The party must find the bracelets and restore honor before blood is spilled.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Storm-Blessed Child:</strong> A child born during a thunder-hail has daunting omens —
          lightning-flecked eyes and prophetic dreams. Protecting the child during a pilgrimage to Vulture’s Reach draws
          both reverent allies and opportunistic foes.</li>
        <li><strong>Ruins of the North:</strong> Half-buried ruins hum with spirit echoes. Some nomads hint at an
          ancient matriarch’s tomb; others suspect a corruption tied to the Mole. Exploration risks spirit tests and
          corrupted guardians.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="hooks-usage"><strong>How to Use in Play</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short Encounter:</strong> Escort a caravan between two shrines while a localized sand-tempest
          (Kareshi’s test) arises.</li>
        <li><strong>Longer Arc:</strong> Unravel the Burrowed Hand’s influence on a sacred shrine; free a captive spirit
          and restore balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Roleplay Opportunities:</strong> Make the party learn a short Journey-Poem or perform a Storm-Dance
          to earn the tabaxi’s trust — success opens trading and alliances, failure may provoke suspicion.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="visual-and-sensory"><strong>Visual & Sensory Details</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wind-chimes that speak in long, thin tones when the desert breathes.</li>
        <li>Sand that smells faintly of metal after storms (a scent the nomads liken to Kareshi’s feather). </li>
        <li>Cairns wearing strips of cloth and polished bone, each with a carved couplet of poetry nailed into the
          stone.</li>
        <li>Dune-camels with braided tassels and small metal discs that clang to mark herd movement.</li>
      </ul>
