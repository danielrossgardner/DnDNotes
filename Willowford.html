    <div class="panel">
      <strong>Population:</strong> ~1,050 (70% Human, 25% Half-Elf, 5% Other)
      <strong>Primary Trade:</strong> River fishing, woodworking, small-scale farming, silver mining.
      <strong>Tone:</strong> A prosperous but humble settlement, balancing the material wealth of its mines with deep
      reverence for the natural spirits.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Silverstream Hills:</strong> Rich in ore and forest. Dotted with shrines at key passes.</li>
        <li><strong>The Silverstream Mines:</strong> Lifeblood of the economy. Shaft #3 breached a cavern leading toward the
          Underdark decades ago. It was collapsed and sealed, but faint traces of spirit energy — and stranger things —
          remain.</li>
        <li><strong>Old Quarry:</strong> Abandoned and unstable. Said to be haunted by restless stone spirits.</li>
        <li><strong>Duskwind Forest:</strong> Wild and deep, inhabited by game, fey, and ancient spirits. Path shrines mark
          safe entry and exits.</li>
        <li><strong>Southroad &amp; Riverlands:</strong> Connect Willowford to distant cities. The Silverstream crossing is
          both lifeline and vulnerability, overseen by the ferryman.</li>
