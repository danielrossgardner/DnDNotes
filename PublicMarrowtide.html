    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Village of Marrowtide</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Population:</em> ~240 (85% Human, 10% Half-Elf, 5% Other)</li>
        <li><em>Primary Trade:</em> Whaling, fishing, barley brewing, trade with inland halfling farmers.</li>
        <li><em>Tone:</em> A hardy, sea-weathered community where tradition and the sea’s rhythm guide life. Stoic and
          humble, but proud of their whale-bone artistry and songs carried over the surf.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Surrounding Geography</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lustrous Coast</strong> – A dramatic shoreline of cliffs and rocky beaches where veins of crystal and mineral shards catch the dawn light,
        scattering it into shimmering colors. The sight is said to be a blessing from the sea.</li>
        <li><strong>Bitter Sea</strong> – The vast ocean stretching eastward, cold and unyielding. Its waters are harsher than the calmer bays, with steep swells,
        sudden storms, and currents that test even the most seasoned sailors. Whalers and fishers of Marrowtide venture here
        only with reverence and caution.</li>
        <li><strong>Cliffside Shrines</strong> – Smaller shrines and carved markers are found atop nearby cliffs,
          overlooking the sea. Offerings here are left during storms, believed to keep ships safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Upper Halfling Farms</strong> – Barley, vegetables, and other crops are grown inland by halfling
          families. They trade regularly with Marrowtide, exchanging produce for whale oil, fish, and sea goods.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Village Layout & Landmarks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stone Houses</strong> – Whitewashed with dark slate roofs. Many feature whale-bone lintels or
          decorative
          scrimshaw carvings.</li>
        <li><strong>The Whale Bones</strong> – A communal space where massive carved whale bones are displayed. Each
          family
          contributes their lineage or stories here, creating a bone-etched history of the village.</li>
        <li><strong>Shrines of the Tide</strong> – Stone and wood posts erected along the shallows, just tall enough to
          stand above the waves at high tide. Offerings of shells, fish oil, and barley drink are placed here, said to
          keep
          the sea’s spirits calm.</li>
        <li><strong>The Brew-Hall</strong> – Heart of the community. A place for drinking, shanty-singing, festivals,
          and
          resolving disputes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Culture & Traditions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Barley Brew</strong> – A strong, smoky drink brewed in the village and consumed daily. Outsiders
          often
          find it too harsh, but locals prize it as their lifeblood.</li>
        <li><strong>Shanty Festival</strong> – Held every autumn after the whales are hunted. Villagers gather in the
          Brew-Hall for a contest of shanties, judged by crowd applause and endurance. The prestige for the winning
          family
          lasts until the next festival.</li>
        <li><strong>Whale Bone Carving</strong> – Every family owns whale bone jewelry, from carved beads to intricate
          scrimshaw pendants. The artistry is passed down generations, and families carve their histories into larger
          bones
          for communal display.</li>
        <li><strong>Tide Offerings</strong> – Rituals at the tide shrines mark major events—before hunts, after
          childbirth,
          or at funerals.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Government & Leadership</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Council by Assembly</strong> – No permanent council. Instead, when important decisions arise, the
          elder
          calls the village together. Every adult votes, and the elder casts the deciding vote if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Judicial Role</strong> – The elder also serves as judge for disputes or crimes, though crime is
          exceedingly rare. Most issues are settled communally.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

            <li><em>Role in Worship:</em> Revered and feared as the spirit that keeps whalers honest—those who grow too

              lost tools, or spoiled grain.</li>
