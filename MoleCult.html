                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>A secretive necromantic cult centered on a corrupted spirit-animal: a vast, blind mole whose presence warps
                    earth and flesh. The cult believes that by devouring and redirecting the life-spirits of other animals into
                    the Mole, they can concentrate a new, terrible power — one that will let the Burrowed Hand rend open a rift
                    where the corruption comes from and reshape the world. Most true believers are <strong>shadar-kai
                        elves</strong>, though sympathizers and agents operate in surface cities and mining towns.</p>
        
                <h3>Name & Symbolism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common Name:</strong> The Burrowed Hand</li>
                    <li><strong>Inner Name:</strong> <em>Thul-Khat, Maw of the Deep Thumb</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Mark:</strong> A tattoo of a <strong>double-thumbed hand</strong> (a palm with an extra thumb
                        alongside the natural one). Simple ink for initiates, scarification for higher ranks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gesture:</strong> Members curl thumbs together and tap the earth three times before darkening
                        their palms with ash.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Location & Stronghold</h3>
                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Secluded hills at the western end of the mountain range. The area is dotted with
                    dugout dwellings that blend into terraces of stone and packed earth.</p>
                <p><strong>Secret City:</strong> A subterranean settlement called <em>Grathun’s Hollow</em>, hidden beneath the
                    hills. From above, it looks like a field of strange mounds and collapsed rock. Locals whisper of low humming
                    at night.</p>
                <p><strong>The Mole’s Complex:</strong> Deep beneath Grathun’s Hollow lies a cavernous set of tunnels and
                    chambers where the Corrupted Mole dwells. The place is semi-living, walls marked by pale roots and veins of
                    tainted crystal, with growths of <strong>cancerous tissue</strong> spreading throughout.</p>
        
                <h3>The Corrupted Mole (Thul-Khat)</h3>
                <p>Once a spirit of patience and soil renewal, the mole has been <strong>warped by corruption</strong>. It
                    embodies a twisted Death/Nature blend: hungry, blind, and absorbent of life-force.</p>
                <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A colossal mole, skin like churned earth and scar tissue, no eyes but with
                    pale-sheen pits where sight might have been. Its forepaws are grotesquely polydactyl — many thumb-like
                    digits used for frantic digging. The Mole is a mound of blind, twitching flesh and <strong>cancerous
                        growth</strong>. Its body swells with tumors that pulse and split, spreading corruption around it.</p>
                <p><strong>Powers:</strong> Where the Mole’s influence is strong, plants rot, animals become aggressive or
                    deformed, and spirits are silenced or twisted. It can lend fragments of its vitality to adherents, but the
                    blessings drain and warp them over time.</p>
        
                <h3>Beliefs & Theology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Tenet:</strong> True power lies beneath. By feeding other spirits to the Mole, they are
                        forging a concentrated font of power capable of calling open the corruption’s source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ritual Logic:</strong> Creatures and spirits are ritually “unbound,” their animist energy
                        extracted through necromantic rites and channeled below into the Mole. The cult calls this <em>tunneling
                            the Echo</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ascetic Extremes:</strong> The most fervent blind themselves, live in tunnels, and take on the
                        mole’s habits. Self-blinding is considered a sacrament.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Organization & Ranks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mole-Sworn:</strong> Initiates, often surface-dwellers or miners. Small hand tattoo, tasked with
                        menial work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hand-Bearers:</strong> Experienced hunters and ritualists, leading small teams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Earthen Priests:</strong> Elder necromancers who perform the spirit-draining rites and tend the
                        Mole’s growths.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Deep Thumb:</strong> Cult leader, believed to speak with the Mole’s voice. Commands the
                        effort to open the rift.</li>
                    <li><strong>Molekin:</strong> Rare adepts blessed with the Mole’s power, often warped by cancerous
                        mutations.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Methods & Operations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hunting & Feeding:</strong> Capture animals and spirit-bearers, drain their essence into the
                        earth for the Mole.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corruption Summoning:</strong> Animate <strong>cancerous spawn</strong> — twisted beasts with
                        tumors and growths, used as guardians and hunters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infiltration:</strong> Cells of the cult live undercover in towns and cities, planting
                        corruption and sabotaging shrines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trade:</strong> Sell tainted reagents or relics on black markets, spreading corruption further.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Cultural Markers & Practices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Double-Thumb Tattoo:</strong> The mark of membership, wrist for low rank, palm scars for the
                        inner circle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blindening Rite:</strong> Voluntary destruction of sight to emulate the Mole.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mole-Burials:</strong> Members buried shallow so the Mole may claim their echoes; the earth
                        above often bulges with <strong>cancerous outgrowths</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Language:</strong> Tapping codes and subterranean slang are used in tunnels.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>The Rift Agenda</h3>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Tear open the seam where the corruption originates, allowing its flood into the world.
                    They believe this will reshape the surface into a kingdom for the Mole, with the Burrowed Hand as rulers.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Means:</strong> Feed enough animist energy into the Mole to cause it to thrash and pierce the veil.
                    Its tunneling will fracture the barriers between worlds.</p>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Cycles of patience followed by sudden, violent feeding frenzies.</p>
        
                <h3>Tactics & Threats</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cult Patrols:</strong> Small groups hunting livestock and performing minor rites, using stealth
                        and traps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corrupted Spawn:</strong> Blind, cancer-ridden beasts — wolves, burrowers, and swarms of twisted
                        vermin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ritual Sites:</strong> Desecrated shrines and bone-circles that channel corruption. Destroying
                        them carelessly releases necrotic bursts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infiltrators:</strong> Agents living secretly in cities, undermining shrines and recruiting the
                        desperate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lair Hazards:</strong> Collapsing tunnels, necrotic pools, clouds of spore-like rot, and the
                        Mole’s central chamber, swollen with malignant flesh.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Possible “Gifts”</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mole’s Boon:</strong> Temporary tremorsense, burrowing speed, or necrotic resilience. Each use
                        drains the recipient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cancerous Growths:</strong> Mutations that grant durability but slowly consume the body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bind Echo:</strong> Earthen Priests can trap a spirit in a vessel, creating a phylactery of
                        corrupted energy.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Allies, Rivals & Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rivals:</strong> The Verdant Veil Monastery, Willowford druids, and clerics of Grandmother
                        actively resist them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Impact:</strong> Mines collapse unnaturally, livestock grow ill, and veins of ore are
                        riddled with tumors of stone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-Term Threat:</strong> Left unchecked, the cult spreads corruption into rivers, forests, and
                        even cities.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Plot Seeds</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Missing shrine-keepers in a frontier town are revealed as sacrifices to the Mole.</li>
                    <li>A merchant caravan transporting a relic is ambushed; the cult seeks to corrupt the relic’s spirit.</li>
                    <li>Mines near the western hills are plagued by strange collapses and “daylight tunnels.”</li>
                    <li>A noble secretly marked with the double-thumb seeks to extend the cult’s reach into city politics.</li>
                </ul>
