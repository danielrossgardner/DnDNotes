# DnD Notes (Condensed)

## Veythar
**The Land of Echoes** — a vast island where animist spirits shape land, sea, and culture. Every place hums with spiritual presence, guiding daily life through ritual and reverence.  

### Geography
- **Southwest Desert:** Sun-scorched, dwarves in Petra-like cliff cities.  
- **Central Mountains:** Spine bisecting island; volcanic peak in north.  
- **Northwest/North:** Barren flats into steppe.  
- **Northeast:** Verdant hills, fjord coast (e.g., Karagost).

- **Lustrous Coast:** Crystal cliffs, gleaming sunrise shores.  

### Neighboring Lands
- **Goliath Isle (north):** One vast mountain, tribal clans.  
- **Southern Archipelago:** Elf-dominated, mystical seafarers.  

### Spirits & Corruption
- **Spirit Animals:** Manifestations of natural echoes—whales, ravens, fish schools embodying domains (life, trickery, endurance).  
- **Corruption:** Twists land and spirits into monstrous forms. Recently, it grows stronger, spread by cults.  
- **Balance:** Clerics, druids, and villagers maintain harmony with offerings, shrines, and vigilance.  

### Western Edge
Sparse coasts, deserts, and stony ridges under the omen of the **Great Vulture**, spirit of endurance.  
- Dwarves thrive in canyon-cities.

## The Burrowed Hand (Cult)
Necromantic cult of shadar-kai elves, devoted to the **Corrupted Mole (Thul-Khat)**, once a patient soil spirit now warped into a cancerous, blind monstrosity.  

- **Symbol:** Double-thumbed hand tattoo; scarification for higher ranks.  
- **Base:** *Grathun’s Hollow* — hidden subterranean city in western mountains.

### Beliefs & Practices
- Feed spirits to the Mole (*“tunneling the Echo”*).
