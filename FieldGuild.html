    <div class="panel">
      <strong>Overview:</strong><br>
      The Field Guild of Reverberation Studies is a loose, professional association of wizard-scholars who study
      <em>magical echoes</em>—residual impressions left behind by spirits, shrines, and long-standing natural forces.
      The Guild is not secret, but little known beyond academic and spiritual circles. Its members live embedded
      within communities across Veythar, recording observations, comparing patterns, and exchanging papers through
      correspondence rather than centralized halls. Their work favors careful field study over ritual authority
      or religious doctrine.
