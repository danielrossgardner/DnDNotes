      <h2 id="verdant-veil"><strong>The Verdant Veil Monastery</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Hidden within the Duskwind Forest, the The Verdant Veil Monastery is a white-stone compound ringed by an outer
        wall.
        Moss and ivy soften its stones; the forest presses close, yet inside the walls there is cultivated order and quiet
        beauty.
        The monastery is a place of discipline, craft, and gentle kindness — a refuge where river gnomes come to learn, to
        heal,
        and to listen to the spirits of nature.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Architecture & Grounds</strong> – White stone buildings, shaded cloisters, and tiled courtyards. Paths
          wind from
          the gate through meditation gardens to mosaicked halls. Outside the wall the woods are wild; inside, every surface
          reflects
          intention and care.</li>

        <li><strong>Craft & Practice</strong> – Novices learn patience through simple daily labors; a signature monastery
          practice
          is the crafting of intricate tile mosaics that depict river currents, forest scenes, and spirit-animals. The
          mosaics are
          both art and liturgy — offerings in stone to the land’s spirits.</li>

        <li><strong>Forest Meditation</strong> – Senior monks take meditation into Duskwind itself, attuning to the forest’s
          whispers
          and listening for spirit-echoes. These walks are part pilgrimage, part study, and central to their doctrine of
          “flow.”</li>

        <li><strong>Warrior Orders & Cleansings</strong> – When corruption appears in the forest (blighted beasts, uncanny
          spores),
          small detachments of warrior-monks and spirit elders march out. Their goal is to subdue and cleanse — balancing
          the land
          rather than destroying it.</li>

        <li><strong>House of Guidance & Healing</strong> – Part of the monastery functions as a spiritual center and
          hospital: a quiet
          infirmary for river gnomes and travelers seeking counsel, folk remedies, or recovery after dangerous river
          voyages. Herbs,
          careful rituals, and patient nursing are preferred to drastic measures.</li>

        <li><strong>Life & Tone</strong> – Days are simple and often quiet. Mealtimes are communal. Discipline and kindness
          are taught
          together; the monks measure virtue by service and serenity rather than by outward glory.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="monastery-services"><strong>Services & Visiting Guidelines</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spiritual Guidance:</strong> River gnomes and others may request counsel from the abbot or elders.
          Sessions blend
          talking, silence, and small ritual acts (placing a river-stone, tying a willow strand).</li>
        <li><strong>Healing & Recuperation:</strong> The infirmary treats wounds, exhaustion, and spirit-taint. Fresh herbs,
          poultices,
          and time are the primary healers; more severe cases are sanctified with meditative cleansings.</li>
        <li><strong>Apprenticeship:</strong> Artisans and novices may apply to study mosaics or river practices.
          Apprenticeship requires
          long vows of patience and regular service.</li>
        <li><strong>Requests for Aid:</strong> Villagers petition the monastery to respond to corruption or blight. The
          monastery sends
          small cleansing teams when the danger is within their capacity, or issues counsel to coordinate a wider response.
