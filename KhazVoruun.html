    <h1 id="khaz-voruun"><strong>Khaz-Voruun — The City of the Burning Breath</strong></h1>

    <div class="panel">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> Carved into blood-red canyon walls, Khaz-Voruun is a dwarven bastion of forges,
      cisterns, and carved facades. Silent most days except for the monthly caravan rites, the city channels dragon
      imagery, ornate metalwork, and a ritual balance of fire and water in its architecture and culture.
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="approach-serpent-hall"><strong>Approach &amp; Serpent Hall</strong></h2>
      <p>
        The canyon that leads to Khaz-Voruun is typically eerily silent, broken only by scheduled caravans. Travelers
        enter the city through the <strong>Serpent Hall</strong> — a long, vaulted corridor where twin serpentine
        dragons
        coil in relief along opposite walls. Each dragon’s eye is set with topaz, each scale etched with scenes from
        dwarven legend. The hall opens into a great chamber with a massive steel door, its surface engraved with the
        Emberthane history.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="city-layout"><strong>City Layout</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the great door the city branches into three main paths:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right Path — Market Vaults:</strong> Lantern-lit corridors and vaulted stalls where lacquered
          metalwork,
          indigo desert-woven cloth, spices, and fine desert goods are traded. The smell of oil, pepper, and brass dust
          hangs heavy.</li>
        <li><strong>Left Path — Mines of Ember Vein:</strong> A descending artery into the workshop levels and ore
          veins,
          with vent tunnels carved to carry smoke away to the desert surface — the odd sight of smoke seeping from the
          sand hints at forges below.</li>
        <li><strong>Central Path — Palace Approach:</strong> Ascends through tiered courtyards, still-water basins, and
          red
          sand gardens toward terraces and the imperial palace.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="palace"><strong>The Palace of the Stoneflame</strong></h2>
      <p>
        The palace blends strength and ceremony: steel beams curve like dragon wings above reflective pools and
        sand-gardens.
        Bronze braziers shaped as coiled serpents burn incense; terraces host quiet alcoves for counsel and ritual. The
        palace balances the austerity of the forge with the tempering presence of the city’s cisterns.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="rulers"><strong>Rulers</strong></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Emperor Dharun Emberthane — The Stoneflame</strong><br>
        Embodiment of the forge’s endurance; his rule emphasizes steady strength and ritual mastery of fire and metal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Empress Kaela Emberthane — The Voice of the Cisterns</strong><br>
        Keeper of the sacred waters and mediator between flame and life; she oversees the city’s cisterns, rites of
        renewal, and the balance that sustains the desert hold.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="culture-spirit"><strong>Culture &amp; Spirit</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Khaz-Voruun’s dwarves live by the principle of <em>silent flame</em> — power restrained until called. Reds and
        indigos dominate decoration, dragon motifs appear in armor and lacquer, and guards wear ornamental-but-effective
        lamellar with spears and broad shields. Households keep <strong>secret desert entrances</strong>, a tradition
        from
        ancient sieges and a practical safeguard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city’s artisans produce desert-woven cloth, fine metalwork, and spice blends traded north to the Lowroad and
        south toward Freeport. Smoke vents and hidden shafts shape the skyline; at dusk the carved dragons seem to watch
        the sands for any who would test the city’s silence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="dwarven-culture"><strong>Dwarven Cultural Colors &amp; Symbolism</strong></h2>
      <p>
        The dwarves of Khaz-Voruun express their devotion to the Twin Dragons through the colors they wear and the
        artistry of their craft. Each hue carries sacred meaning tied to their homeland and its spirits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> The lifeblood of the desert and the color of the stone canyons that cradle their
          cities. It symbolizes endurance and the flame of the forge.</li>
        <li><strong>Indigo:</strong> Drawn from mineral-rich dye and deep wells, this color represents the hidden
          waters of the cisterns — calm strength and unseen vitality beneath the earth.</li>
        <li><strong>Gold:</strong> Reserved for moments of revelation and mastery, honoring <strong>Solmara the
            Golden Wind</strong>. Used in inlay, adornments, and ceremonial armor.</li>
        <li><strong>Azure Blue:</strong> A rare and sacred pigment kept for rites of peace, reflection, and
          remembrance, honoring <strong>Thalun the Silent Wave</strong>. Found in murals near the cisterns and
          temple pools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During great festivals, the desert skies are lined with banners of red and indigo, but at the ceremony’s
        height, the priests unveil gold and azure cloths — symbolic of the dragons’ dance, uniting flame and stillness.
      </p>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 <strong>The Twin Dragons of the Desert</strong></h2>
      <h3 id="solmara"><strong>Solmara the Golden Wind</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Honorific:</strong> The Breath of Knowing<br>
        <strong>Domain:</strong> Knowledge (Cunning, Action)<br>
        <strong>Tone:</strong> Brilliant, restless, and wise — Solmara embodies insight that drives motion and change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solmara is said to glide through the desert skies as a shimmering current of gold light, her wings scattering
        mirages that reveal fragments of hidden truths. When she exhales, sand lifts into intricate spirals — a sign
        that some secret or invention is about to emerge. Scholars and smiths alike whisper her name before attempting
        acts of creation. Legends tell that she once traced the first dwarven runes into the canyon walls using the
        light of her scales. To follow her wisdom is to move forward; to stagnate is to lose her favor.
      </p>

      <h3 id="thalun"><strong>Thalun the Silent Wave</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Honorific:</strong> The Still Breath Beneath<br>
        <strong>Domain:</strong> Peace (Wisdom, Patience, Temperance)<br>
        <strong>Tone:</strong> Serene and eternal — Thalun embodies stillness, endurance, and the balance of water
        hidden beneath stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thalun is said to dwell beneath the sands, coiling through deep aquifers and forgotten cisterns. His eyes are
        the cool reflections of moonlight on still water, and his passing brings soft winds that soothe the heart.
        During times of drought or unrest, dwarves claim to see his blue shape shimmer beneath the surface of the dunes,
        heralding calm rains. He is invoked in rituals of reconciliation and in moments when patience must temper flame.
        When Solmara and Thalun dance in the heavens, gold and blue light weave together, painting the sky violet —
        a sign of perfect harmony between knowledge and peace.
