    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Village of Marrowtide</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Population:</em> ~240 (85% Human, 10% Half-Elf, 5% Other)</li>
        <li><em>Primary Trade:</em> Whaling, fishing, barley brewing, trade with inland halfling farmers.</li>
        <li><em>Tone:</em> A hardy, sea-weathered community where tradition and the sea’s rhythm guide life. Stoic and
          humble, but proud of their whale-bone artistry and songs carried over the bay.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Village Layout & Landmarks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stone Houses</strong> – Whitewashed with dark slate roofs. Many feature whale-bone lintels or decorative
          scrimshaw carvings.</li>
        <li><strong>The Whale Bones</strong> – A communal space where massive carved whale bones are displayed. Each family
          contributes their lineage or stories here, creating a bone-etched history of the village.</li>
        <li><strong>Shrines of the Tide</strong> – Stone and wood posts erected along the shallows, just tall enough to
          stand above the waves at high tide. Offerings of shells, fish oil, and barley drink are placed here, said to keep
          the sea’s spirits calm.</li>
        <li><strong>The Bay</strong> – The upper left arm of a great southern bay. The waters here are calmer, making them
          the training grounds for youths, though whaling ships travel far beyond the bay to hunt.</li>
        <li><strong>The Brew-Hall</strong> – Heart of the community. A place for drinking, shanty-singing, festivals, and
          resolving disputes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Culture & Traditions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Barley Brew</strong> – A strong, smoky drink brewed in the village and consumed daily. Outsiders often
          find it too harsh, but locals prize it as their lifeblood.</li>
        <li><strong>Shanty Festival</strong> – Held every autumn after the whales are hunted. Villagers gather in the
          Brew-Hall for a contest of shanties, judged by crowd applause and endurance. The prestige for the winning family
          lasts until the next festival.</li>
        <li><strong>Coming of Age Ritual</strong> – At the age of 16, each youth must spend a night alone on the bay in a
          small boat. Returning safely by dawn marks their passage into adulthood. They often bring back fish or driftwood
          as proof of their journey, though survival itself is what matters.</li>
        <li><strong>Whale Bone Carving</strong> – Every family owns whale bone jewelry, from carved beads to intricate
          scrimshaw pendants. The artistry is passed down generations, and families carve their histories into larger bones
          for communal display.</li>
        <li><strong>Tide Offerings</strong> – Rituals at the tide shrines mark major events—before hunts, after childbirth,
          or at funerals.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Government & Leadership</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Council by Assembly</strong> – No permanent council. Instead, when important decisions arise, the elder
          calls the village together. Every adult votes, and the elder casts the deciding vote if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Judicial Role</strong> – The elder also serves as judge for disputes or crimes, though crime is
          exceedingly rare. Most issues are settled communally.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Surrounding Geography</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Upper Halfling Farms</strong> – Barley, vegetables, and other crops are grown inland by halfling
          families. They trade regularly with Marrowtide, exchanging produce for whale oil, fish, and sea goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Bay Waters</strong> – Rich with fish and calmer than the open sea, the bay is where the coming-of-age
          rituals are performed. True whaling voyages happen far beyond the bay’s mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Western Port City</strong> – Across the bay lies the island’s largest city, a bustling port that
          connects the island to the southern archipelago and beyond. Marrowtide trades whale oil as well as occasional bone
          crafts and some brew.</li>
        <li><strong>Cliffside Shrines</strong> – Smaller shrines and carved markers are found atop nearby cliffs,
          overlooking the bay. Offerings here are left during storms, believed to keep ships safe.</li>
      </ul>
