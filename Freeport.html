    <h1 id="city-freeport"><strong>City of Freeport (Shellshore)</strong></h1>
    <div class="panel">
      <strong>Population:</strong> ~7,000 (Highly diverse: Humans, Half-Orcs, Drow, Elves, Halflings, and many
      others)<br>
      <strong>Primary Trade:</strong> International trade hub for goods from the southern archipelago, inland farming
      produce, precious metals and gems from Vey Irinel, whale oil and bone crafts from Marrowtide, and exotic wares
      from distant continents.<br>
      <strong>Tone:</strong> A bustling, prosperous port city. Order is tightly enforced by the Merchants’ Guild, yet
      the city thrives as a crossroads of cultures, songs, and trade. Locals still whisper of its old name, Shellshore,
      and the turtle spirit that once made its home in Abandon Bay.

      <h2 id="surrounding-geography"><strong>Surrounding Geography</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Abandon Bay:</strong> A vast, crescent-shaped bay formed by the turtle spirit’s departure. Freeport
          sits on its upper right side, overlooking calm waters that open into treacherous sea routes.</li>
        <li><strong>The Grassy Plain:</strong> Rising north of Freeport, a fertile plateau dotted with halfling
          farmsteads and caravan routes heading inland.</li>
        <li><strong>Southern Archipelago:</strong> Chain of islands to the south. Source of spices, rare woods, and
          exotic fruits that flow through Freeport’s markets.</li>
        <li><strong>The Lower Ocean Routes:</strong> Distant foreign vessels reach Freeport, making it one of the few
          cities on the island where truly foreign goods and faces are common.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="layout--landmarks"><strong>Layout &amp; Landmarks</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-style-none">
          <strong>The Old Quarter (Shellshore)</strong> – The original fishing and whaling village. Narrow, twisting
          streets, haphazardly built stone and timber homes, shrines to the sea, and taverns with weathered whale bones
          above their doors.
        </li>
        <li class="list-style-none">
          <strong>The Merchant’s Ring</strong> – The organized heart of Freeport. Wide avenues, neat rows of warehouses,
          guildhalls, markets, and clean plazas. This is where the Merchants’ Guild enforces its authority most
          strictly.
        </li>
        <li class="list-style-none">
          <strong>The Shorefront</strong> – Bustling docks stretching along Abandon Bay. Ships from the southern
          archipelago, inland rivers, and far-flung kingdoms all moor here. Guarded day and night by the <em>Shore
            Watch</em>.
        </li>
        <li class="list-style-none">
          <strong>The Ascendant Road</strong> – A broad, cobbled road climbing gradually from the shore through newer
          districts up toward the grassy plain. Inns, stables, and caravan yards line the road.
        </li>
        <li class="list-style-none">
          <strong>The Turtle’s Rest Plaza</strong> – A central square honoring the city’s animist roots. At its heart
          stands a massive stone carving of a turtle’s shell, surrounded by offerings of coins, driftwood, and shells.
          Locals still refer to the city as Shellshore here.
        </li>
        <li class="list-style-none">
          <strong>The Guildhall</strong> – Headquarters of the Merchants’ Guild. A fortress-like marble and
          granite hall that also serves as the city’s central bank. From here, strict laws of trade, tariffs, and
          contracts are administered.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="government--law"><strong>Government &amp; Law</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Merchants’ Guild</strong> – Holds ultimate authority. Oversees taxation, harbor tariffs, weights
          and measures, trade licenses, and justice in trade disputes. Wealth equals influence in Freeport.</li>
        <li><strong>The Shore Watch</strong> – A professional city guard funded by the guild. Patrols the docks,
          markets, and roads to ensure peace and order. Swift and often harsh in dealing with lawbreakers, but widely
          respected for keeping Freeport safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Justice of Coin</strong> – Laws are based on written guild codes. Punishments lean toward fines,
          forfeitures, indenture, or exile rather than corporal punishment, keeping labor and trade flowing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="culture--society"><strong>Culture &amp; Society</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Nearly every people of the island and beyond can be found here. Inns and markets
          bustle with half-orcs from the western coast, drow traders from Vey Irinel, halfling farmers, dwarves from
          distant mountains, and human sailors from across the sea.</li>
        <li><strong>Old vs. New:</strong> Locals from the Shellshore quarter cling to traditions of whaling songs,
          tide-offerings, and turtle-spirit lore. New Freeport citizens in the Merchant’s Ring embrace order,
          prosperity, and commerce above all.</li>
        <li><strong>Festivals:</strong> Trade fairs every spring and autumn coincide with equinoxes, drawing foreign
          merchants. Summer solstice celebrations still honor the turtle spirit, with boat races across Abandon Bay. In
          winter, the Guild sponsors a Festival of Lanterns, lighting the harbor in gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Drinks &amp; Food:</strong> Local brews mingle with fine wines
          from distant shores. Seafood dominates local cuisine—mossbacks, shellfish, and bay crabs—though exotic imports
          flow in steadily.</li>
      </ul>
