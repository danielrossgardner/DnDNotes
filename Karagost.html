      <h2 id="culture--society"><strong>Culture &amp; Society</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mariner Tradition:</strong> Society mirrors the structure of a great sailing ship—elders serve as
          “captains,” while families are organized like crews. Orders, discipline, and hierarchy are valued.</li>
        <li><strong>Uniforms:</strong> Serving sailors and marines wear crisp <em>white uniforms</em>, making them
          instantly recognizable in any port. Layfolk wear shades of <em>blue</em>, symbolizing their connection to the
          sea but distinction from active service.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Competitions:</strong> Wrestling, rowing races, stone-lifting, and sparring matches are
          beloved entertainments. Victories earn prestige and emblems to adorn uniforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Sea Reverence:</strong> They show strong reverence to the spirits of the sea—particularly winds,
          currents, and storm fronts. Offerings are made before every voyage, and sailors often tattoo wave motifs instead of shrine offerings.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>

          from the drow for fish, ship timber, and naval support.</li>
        <li><strong>Eastern Origins:</strong> The settlement’s is an outpost from the east, and Karagost
          maintains strong trade ties with their homeland beyond the island.</li>
        <li><strong>Freeport:</strong> Occasional ships sail south to Freeport, bringing goods and news. Though not
          their main trade route, Freeport is valued as a cosmopolitan hub.</li>
        <li><strong>Maritime Defenders:</strong> Karagost ships are crewed by <em>fierce marines</em> trained to repel
          marauders and pirates. Their reputation as disciplined fighters makes them respected across the island.</li>
