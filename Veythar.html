        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Veythar is known as <strong>the Land of Echoes</strong>, where every mountain, stream, and grove hums with
          spiritual presence. The people believe their world resonates with voices of spirit animals and natural forces,
          each echo shaping both geography and culture. Animism guides daily life, and the echoes of spirits can be felt
          everywhere — in the whisper of waves, the rustle of grass, and the silence of stone.</p>
    
        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Southwest:</strong> Harsh desert where dwarves dwell in <em>Petra-like cliff cities</em>, carving
            entire halls and dwellings into the stone.</li>
          <li><strong>Central Range:</strong> A great mountain chain bisects Veythar. A vast volcano dominates the northern
            portion, looming as both a sacred and dangerous landmark.</li>
          <li><strong>Northwest:</strong> A barren expanse resembling the Gobi Desert, fading into grassy steppes toward the
            center. Further east, the land grows more verdant with rolling hills and fjords along the northeast coast.</li>
          <li><strong>Eastern Desert:</strong> Roamed by <strong>Tabaxi nomads</strong>, masters of endurance and hunters of
            wind and shadow.</li>
          <li><strong>Duskwind Forest:</strong> Dense and spiritual woodland in the east, home to hidden settlements of
            <strong>river gnomes</strong> and the Verdant Veil Monastery.</li>
          <li><strong>Abandon Bay:</strong> A vast bay in the south, its waters tied to tales of a turtle spirit that swam
            away, leaving the land fractured. Marrowtide and Freeport rest on its shores.</li>
          <li><strong>Bitter Sea & Lustrous Coast:</strong> The southern waters are stormy and treacherous, known as the
            Bitter Sea, while the Lustrous Coast glimmers with safe harbors, pearls, and fertile fishing grounds.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Neighboring Lands</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Island of the Goliaths:</strong> North of Veythar, a smaller island dominated by a single towering
            peak. Goliath tribes dwell on its slopes.</li>
          <li><strong>Southern Archipelago:</strong> Scattered islands to the south, sparsely populated but largely home to
            elves. Known for mystical seafaring traditions and hidden groves.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Peoples & Culture</h3>
        <p>The people of Veythar are diverse, their lives interwoven with animist traditions. Halfling farmers, river gnome
          traders, drow merchants, half-orc mariners, and more live across its varied lands. In every culture, rituals,
          offerings, and festivals maintain harmony with spirits — though corruption always threatens to unbalance this
          fragile relationship.</p>

          <div class="abstract">Manifestations of natural echoes and the threat of dark corruption</div>

        <h3>Spirit Animals</h3>
        <p>On Veythar, <strong>spirit animals</strong> are manifestations of natural echoes — concentrations of the island’s
          animist energy given form. A school of menhaden may gather as a spirit of life, a great raven may embody trickery,
          or a whale may represent endurance and the deep rhythms of nature. These spirits are revered, feared, and
          bargained with, as they embody the voices of the world itself.</p>
    
        <h3>Corruption</h3>
        <p>Though the land is vibrant, <strong>darker echoes</strong> sometimes coalesce into corruption. When this occurs,
          creatures twist into monstrous forms, losing balance and harmony. Forests may rot, rivers may choke, and beasts
          may become feral with unnatural hunger.</p>
        <p>While corruption has long appeared in isolated instances, recent stirrings suggest that the blight is
          <strong>growing stronger and more organized</strong>. Whispers speak of cults and corrupted spirits seeking to
          rend open rifts, allowing the corruption to flood into Veythar unchecked.</p>
    
        <h3>Balance & Vigilance</h3>
        <p>Clerics, druids, monks, and everyday villagers strive to honor the spirits and maintain balance. Shrines are
          tended, festivals of gratitude held, and offerings made to ensure harmony. Yet with the threat of corruption
          rising, more and more of Veythar’s people are being drawn into defending the echoes of their world.</p>
