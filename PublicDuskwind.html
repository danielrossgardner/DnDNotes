    <div class="panel">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overview:</strong> The Duskwind Forest sprawls between two great rivers — the Silverstream to the west
          and the Everspring River to the east. These rivers converge south of the forest, encircling it in their embrace.
          Vast, ancient, and untamed, the forest is one of the wildest places on Veythar.</li>

        <li><strong>Old-Growth Depths:</strong> Towering pines, hemlocks, and oaks form a dense canopy that swallows sound
          and sunlight. Moss carpets the roots and stones, while countless springs and rivulets flow into streams, feeding
          the rivers that guard the forest. The air is heavy with birdsong and the rustle of unseen creatures.</li>

        <li><strong>Spirit of the Hemlock:</strong> At the forest’s heart stands a colossal hemlock tree, older than any
          mortal memory. This tree is the dwelling of one of Veythar’s oldest spirits — a being of the Nature domain,
          embodying endurance, renewal, and the slow wisdom of the land. Pilgrims say the tree hums softly at dawn, and its
          shadow is always cool even in the heat of summer.</li>

        <li><strong>Path Shrines:</strong> At the edges of the forest, simple stone and wooden shrines mark paths considered
          safe for travelers. Offerings of flowers, coins, or food are left at these shrines to honor the forest spirits and
          ensure passage. To ignore the shrines is to risk becoming lost in the shifting mists and trails that confound the
          unwary.</li>

        <li><strong>Clearings & Waters:</strong> Though most of the canopy is unbroken, there are sacred openings where
          sunlight spills onto ponds, lakes, or wildflower meadows. These places serve as gathering spots for game and as
          hidden sanctuaries where spirits linger more visibly.</li>

        <li><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> The Duskwind teems with wildlife — deer, boar, foxes, and countless birds — but
          also harbors creatures of deeper magic. Some are benign guardians, while others are twisted when corruption seeps
          in. Ancient spirits walk unseen, shaping the moods of the forest.</li>

        <li><strong>Character:</strong> The forest is vast, timeless, and mysterious. Hunters, hermits, and wandering monks
          pass through, but none claim mastery over it. To step into the Duskwind is to walk where the boundary between
          mortal and spirit thins, where silence is never empty but always watching.</li>
