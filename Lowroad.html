    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        <strong>Overview:</strong> Stretching along the southern foothills of the Veythar Spine, the <em>The
          Lowroad</em> is a
        well-worn trade road connecting small but vital settlements from the red clay westlands to the shadowed edges
        of
        the
        Duskwind Forest. Each village along the route honors its own local spirit, maintaining a delicate balance
        between
        industry, faith, and the encroaching wilds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hemlock’s Crown Road</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>Usage:</strong> Found in ancient charters, temple records, and among spirit-tenders or scholars.
        <br />
        <strong>Origin:</strong> Named after an ancient grove of mountain hemlocks once crowning the eastern ridge
        where the road first touched the Duskwind Forest. The grove was said to be home to a great bear spirit who
        blessed travelers in exchange for songs.
        <br />
        <strong>Tone:</strong> Poetic and slightly forgotten — the name carries reverence and myth.
        <br />
        <strong>Lore:</strong> Some old maps still mark milestones by the Crowns — a series of carved stones topped
        with carved hemlock fronds, believed to ward travelers from the forest’s shadows.

    <!-- Red Hollow -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="red-hollow"><strong>Red Hollow</strong></h2>
      <strong>Population:</strong> ~600 (50% Human, 20% Halfling, 20% Dwarf, 10% Other) <br>
      <strong>Primary Industry:</strong> Pottery, claywork, copper smelting. <br>
      <strong>Tone:</strong> Industrious and stubborn, Red Hollow thrives amid its red cliffs and mineral-rich
      streams.
      The forges’ glow stains the twilight sky, and the scent of clay dust clings to every wind.
      <p>
        Red Hollow’s artisans are famed for their burnished pottery and copperwork traded throughout the Foothill Way.
        The
        people leave small offerings of broken clay figurines at dusk to appease the <strong>Red Fox</strong>, a sly
        spirit
        of the <em>Trickery Domain</em> who is said to have taught their ancestors how to find fire within stone. They
        say
        the fox’s laughter can be heard on the wind whenever a kiln cracks from overuse.

    <!-- Barlen’s Field -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="barlens-field"><strong>Barlen’s Field</strong></h2>
      <strong>Population:</strong> ~850 (20% Human, 50% Halfling, 20% Half-Elf, 10% Dwarf) <br>
      <strong>Primary Industry:</strong> Grain farming, barley ale, livestock. <br>
      <strong>Tone:</strong> Rolling farmland and generous hearts define Barlen’s Field. Known for its harvest
      festivals and
      communal granaries, the village serves as a breadbasket for the southern foothills.
      <p>
        The people honor two spirits: a slumbering ox of the <em>Order Domain</em>, representing patience and strength
        in
        labor, and a host of fireflies of the <em>Light Domain</em> that gather at dusk, believed to be fragments of
        the
        ox’s dreams. During midsummer, the villagers release lanterns filled with glowing insects to bless the coming
        harvest — a quiet, golden river of light flowing through their fields.
      </p>

    <!-- Glendor’s Wreath -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="glendors-wreath"><strong>Glendor’s Wreath</strong></h2>
      <strong>Population:</strong> ~920 (55% Human, 30% Half-Elf, 15% Gnome) <br>
      <strong>Primary Industry:</strong> Lumber, charcoal burning, and woodworking. <br>
      <strong>Tone:</strong> A hardy, defensive settlement guarding the road’s midsection, Glendor’s Wreath endures
      the
      storms that roll down from the Spine. Its craftspeople carve fine furniture and weapon hafts, blending beauty
      with
      resilience.
      <p>
        The village’s guardian spirit is a <strong>Grey Wolf</strong> of the <em>War Domain</em>, said to have once
        led the
        people in defending the passes against marauders. Shrines carved with wolf sigils mark their borders, and each
        spring, villagers anoint their tools with ash and oil, whispering oaths to “run with the pack” — a pledge to
        protect one another and their forest home.
      </p>

    <!-- Mossbridge -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="mossbridge"><strong>Mossbridge</strong></h2>
      <strong>Population:</strong> ~780 (50% Human, 35% Half-Elf, 15% Halfling) <br>
      <strong>Primary Industry:</strong> Tanning, herbalism, dye production, and river trade. <br>
      <strong>Tone:</strong> Built on raised causeways along the marshy fringes of the Everspring River, Mossbridge is
      a
      place of quiet voices and soft light. Mist and moss drape its bridges, and the night air hums with whispers from
      the
      reeds.
      <p>
        The villagers venerate an <strong>Owl Spirit</strong> of the <em>Twilight Domain</em> — the “Watcher in the
        Reeds.”
        Offerings of feathers and silver rings are left at shrine posts to guide travelers through fog and
        uncertainty.
        Mossbridge is renowned for its green and indigo dyes, believed to hold traces of the owl’s sight — a subtle
        shimmer
        that reveals patterns only in moonlight.

    <!-- Duskglen -->
    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="duskglen"><strong>Duskglen</strong></h2>
      <strong>Population:</strong> ~650 (40% Human, 35% Half-Elf, 25% Gnome) <br>
      <strong>Primary Industry:</strong> Beekeeping, waxcraft, and herbal distillation. <br>
      <strong>Tone:</strong> A tranquil village half-embraced by the Duskwind Forest, Duskglen’s meadows are alive
      with
      bees, wildflowers, and the steady hum of quiet labor. The people are gentle but steadfast, holding peace in
      their
      craft.
      <p>
        Their protector is a <strong>Great Bear Spirit</strong> of the <em>Peace Domain</em>, known as the “Keeper of
        the
        Hollow Comb.” Its presence is felt in the deep buzzing of hives and the golden warmth of candles blessed in
        its
        name. When tempers rise or travelers quarrel, the villagers light a wax effigy of the bear, letting its slow
        burn
        remind all that peace, like honey, takes patience to gather.
