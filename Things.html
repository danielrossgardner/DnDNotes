              <p class="text--smaller ml-medium mt-none">
                A pale-gray, powdery substance ground from corrupted mushrooms in the caverns beyond the Silverstream
                Mines.
                It has a faint, earthy glow in moonlight. Usually inhaled through a reed tube or mixed into wine.
                Carried in tiny clay vials or wrapped in waxed paper.

            <li><em>Effects (Game Mechanics):</em>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Immediate Effect:</em> Gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and initiative rolls for 1
                  hour.</li>
                <li><em>Lingering Side Effect:</em> At the end of the duration, the user must succeed on a DC 12
                  Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.</li>
                <li><em>Addiction Risk:</em>
                  <p class="text--smaller ml-medium mt-none">
                    If a creature uses Hollowdust more than once within a 7-day period, they must succeed on a DC 14
                    Wisdom saving throw or develop dependency.
                    Dependency means the user suffers disadvantage on all Wisdom saving throws and ability checks
                    until they take another dose.

                Long-term users may develop hallucinations tied to the Mushroom Spirit (Death Domain), hearing whispers
                or seeing fungal growths where none exist.
                Some believe frequent users eventually attract the spirit’s attention, becoming thralls or spore-ridden
                husks.

              A carved wooden crook decorated with gentle animal motifs. You can calm or direct any beast of
              Intelligence 3 or lower within 30 feet, causing it to follow simple commands (stay, come, graze, move) for
              1 minute. Once per short rest, you can cast <em>Animal Friendship</em> (save DC 10) through the crook.

              A 20-foot length of braided silver cord with hooks at both ends. When each end is attached to a solid
              surface and the command word is spoken, the coil becomes completely rigid, like an iron rod. Supports up
              to 500 pounds. Used as a makeshift bridge, anchor, or brace. Another command word releases the effect.
