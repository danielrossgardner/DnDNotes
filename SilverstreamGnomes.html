    <h1 id="river-gnomes"><strong>The River Gnomes of the Silverstream</strong></h1>
    <div class="panel">
      <strong>Homeland:</strong> The Silverstream River and its tributaries, flowing from the northern mountains,
      through the Duskwind Forest, and south toward the sea west of Abandon Bay.<br>
      <strong>Population:</strong> A scattering of minor gnome settlements along the river, with one hidden settlement
      deep in the Duskwind Forest.<br>
      <strong>Tone:</strong> Jovial, curious, and well-traveled. The river gnomes are ferrymen, storytellers, and
      middlefolk of trade, connecting mountain miners, woodland gatherers, inland farmers, and coastal merchants.

      <h2 id="culture--lifestyle"><strong>Culture &amp; Lifestyle</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Boathouses &amp; Rafts:</strong> Many river gnome homes are built directly onto flat-bottomed boats
          or perched on stilts at regular stopping points along the river. Rafts lashed from timber are a common sight,
          carrying goods downstream.</li>
        <li><strong>Jovial Kin:</strong> Known for their laughter, pipe-smoking, and quick songs, they treat strangers
          as friends unless given reason otherwise. Bargaining is often done over drinks or riddles rather than hard
          numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverence:</strong> They honor <strong>Grandmother of the Silverstream</strong>, a spirit of patient
          currents and hidden depths, leaving tokens of polished river stones or carved driftwood at quiet bends.</li>
        <li><strong>Festivals:</strong> River gnomes mark the spring thaw with floating lanterns set adrift, symbolizing
          Grandmother’s blessings carrying their people safely through another year.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="trade--connections"><strong>Trade &amp; Connections</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>River Carriers:</strong> Gnomes transport timber, ore, fish, and furs downstream, and carry coastal
          goods like whale oil, salt, and southern spices back inland.</li>
        <li><strong>Freeport Tie:</strong> While the river doesn’t flow directly into Abandon Bay, many river gnomes
          travel south and trade at Freeport’s markets, serving as vital links between inland resources and sea trade.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Marrowtide Tie:</strong> Whale oil lamps and fish products from Marrowtide often ride gnome rafts
          northward in exchange for barley, fruit, and crafted goods from inland farms.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2 id="duskwind-forest"><strong>Duskwind Forest &amp; the Hidden Settlement</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Duskwind Forest:</strong> A dense and shadowed woodland the Silverstream cuts through. Travelers
          describe strange whispers, sudden mists, and paths that vanish unless one knows the river well.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Settlement:</strong> Known only to the river gnomes, the settlement cannot be found unless
          one disembarks at a particular half-submerged log and follows winding deer trails. It is protected by wards
          and illusions.</li>
        <li><strong>Monastic Sect:</strong> Within this hidden village dwells a sect of gnome monks devoted to balance
          and discipline. They train in fluid, river-inspired martial forms and keep alive old spiritual practices.
          Outsiders almost never see them, though rumors persist of their intervention in forest conflicts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="religion--beliefs"><strong>Religion &amp; Beliefs</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grandmother of the Silverstream:</strong> Seen as a wise, patient spirit, both nurturing and
          dangerous in her hidden currents. She embodies the persistence of water shaping stone and the secrets carried
          in the river’s depths.</li>
        <li><strong>River Omens:</strong> Foam patterns, fish migrations, and the songs of frogs are interpreted as
          Grandmother’s whispers of the future.</li>
        <li><strong>Monks’ Doctrine:</strong> The forest monks teach that discipline comes from listening to the flow of
          life like a river—knowing when to yield and when to carve a new course.</li>
      </ul>
