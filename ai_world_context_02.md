## World — Veythar

### Veythar, the Land of Echoes

**Overview**

Veythar is known as **the Land of Echoes**, where every mountain, stream, and grove hums with spiritual presence. The people believe their world resonates with voices of spirit animals and natural forces, each echo shaping both geography and culture. Animism guides daily life, and the echoes of spirits can be felt everywhere — in the whisper of waves, the rustle of grass, and the silence of stone.

**Geography**

- **Southwest Desert:** A harsh and sun-scorched desert. Home to dwarves who dwell in *Petra-like cliff cities*.
- **Central Mountains:** A range bisecting the island north to south with a volcanic peak in the north.
- **Northwest:** A barren expanse resembling the Gobi Desert, fading into grassy steppes.
- **Northern Steppes:** Grassy steppes in the central part of the north.
- **Northeast:** Verdant rolling hills and fjord settlements like Karagost.
- **South and Southeast:** Fertile rivers, forests, and plains that support thriving trade.
- **Abandon Bay:** A great southern bay of legend; Freeport (Shellshore) sits on its western shore.
- **Bitter Sea:** Treacherous southern waters, infamous for storms.
- **Lustrous Coast:** Crystalline cliffs and rocky beaches that gleam at sunrise.

**Neighboring Lands**

- Island of the Goliaths to the north.
- Southern Archipelago to the south, home largely to elves.

**Peoples & Culture**

The people of Veythar are diverse: halfling farmers, river gnome traders, drow merchants, half-orc mariners, and more. Rituals, offerings, and festivals maintain harmony with spirits, though corruption threatens balance.

### Spirits and Corruption

**Spirit Animals**

Spirit animals are manifestations of natural echoes. They can embody life, trickery, or endurance and are revered, feared, and bargained with.

**Corruption**

Darker echoes sometimes coalesce into corruption that twists creatures and blights the land. Recent signs suggest the blight is growing and more organized, with cults and corrupted spirits attempting to widen the breach.

**Balance & Vigilance**

Clerics, druids, monks, and villagers tend shrines and hold festivals to keep harmony. As corruption rises, more people are drawn into defending the echoes of Veythar.

## Lore

### The Hollow Queen and the Growing Gate

Long-ago mortal queen Nerathis of the Hollow Crown slaughtered spirit-tenders and sparked a seed of corruption that bound her spirit. Now known as the Queen Beneath, she dreams in a dark mirror realm (Llygredd) and influences mortals to build ritual sites that shape a sigil intended to open the Growing Gate and merge realms. Symbols: a spiral descending into a hollow circle encircled by seven lines.

Signs & ritual sites include inverted altars, caves that spiral downward, stone circles with seven broken pillars, and temples where water runs upward.

Adventurer clues: the spiral symbol, dreams of a woman’s voice, shrines whose offerings rot instantly, and fractured cult doctrines.

---

### The Burrowed Hand (Mole Cult)

Secretive necromantic cult centered on a corrupted spirit-mole (Thul-Khat). Led by shadar-kai and organized with ranks from Mole-Sworn to The Deep Thumb. Practices include spirit-draining rites (tunneling the Echo), blindening rites, and feeding the Mole to grow its power and open a rift.

The Mole’s presence warps earth and flesh, spawns corrupted beasts, and infiltrates towns. Tactics include hunting & feeding, corruption summoning, infiltration, and trade of tainted reagents. Plot seeds: missing shrine-keepers, ambushed caravans, collapsing mines, and noble conspirators.

---

### Order of the Pale Garden (Pale Gardeners)

An ancient human sect north of Willowford that revered decay and fungal cycles as divine transformation. Teachings described the Deep Bloom — a spirit of rot and rebirth. Ritual tools and relics include the Trowel of Quiet Bloom (uncommon wondrous item) and the Sporeveil Censer (rare wondrous item). Remnants exist in caves called the Pale Hollows; folklore persists in Willowford.

---

### River Gnomes of the Silverstream

River gnomes live along the Silverstream, building boathouses and rafts, serving as ferrymen and middlefolk of trade. They revere Grandmother of the Silverstream, hold festivals with floating lanterns, and maintain a hidden settlement and monastic sect in the Duskwind Forest. They connect Marrowtide, Willowford, Freeport, and Vey Irinel via trade along the river.
